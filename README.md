# **Cryptocurrencies_Analysis**

## **Background**

The project aims to analyse the cryptocurrency data to ensure that we make an informed decision. The tool utilised for this analysis is the 'Unsupervised Machine Learning' technique. 

In Deliverable one, we cleaned and scaled the data to make sure we have a proper dataset to feed into our unsupervised machine learning algorithm. This step is prudent since unorganised data can lead to noise in the system and that can ultimately give undesirable or skewed outcomes.

In the second deliverable, we created a data frame with 3 Principal Component Analyses (PCA). The third deliverable was to determine the K-Means value by inertia graph.

The final deliverable was to visualise the data using 3d and 2d Scattered plots. The data were divided based on the two main variables, i.e. TotalCoinSupply and TotalCoinsMined. One can determine the popularity of cryptocurrencies on a larger level and can make an informed decision in terms of investment.

## **Conclusion**

Although the analysis gives an idea in terms of coins mining scale and supply factors, more variables need to be analysed to make more informed decisions about the investment in Cryptocurrencies.
